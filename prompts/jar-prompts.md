### With Github Copilot 

### Prompt 1
Hello, you're an expert developer in typescript and jest tester. I would like to create the necessary unit tests for the fille #file:candidateService.ts to cover all the possible cases.

Don't forget to add the necessary mocks because the service interacts with the database.

Before give me the code, explain me what you will do

### Prompt 2
perfect, continue please

### Prompt 3
When I executed the command to validate the tests, in some scenarios I have this error:

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')

Could you fix it?

### Prompt 4
Try another way because this breaks all the tests
